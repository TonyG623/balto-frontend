# Movie Searcher Frontend

## Installation
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run start` to kick off the server. 
3. Currently this frontend expects you to be running the backend on localhost at port 8080. 

# Todos
1. Expand test coverage to movie file.
2. Add onscroll loading to the table, currently its set to just show the first 1000. Would want the table to load on scroll.
3. General polishing that I ran out of time to do :)
