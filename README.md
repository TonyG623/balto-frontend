3. Currently this frontend expects you to be running the backend on localhost at port 8080. 

# Todos
1. Add unit tests around frontend using https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/
2. Add onscroll loading to the table, currently its set to just show the first 1000. Would want the table to load on scroll.
